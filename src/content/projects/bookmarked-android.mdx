## Overview

Beetroot7 is a web application designed to help users reduce food waste by tracking their food inventory, suggesting recipes based on available ingredients, and facilitating food sharing within communities. Built with Vite, React, and TypeScript, the app offers a seamless and responsive user experience across devices.

## Goals and Motivation

Food waste is a significant global issue, contributing to environmental degradation and resource inefficiency. Motivated by the desire to make a positive impact, I developed Beetroot7 to provide individuals with practical tools to manage their food consumption more effectively and foster a culture of sustainability.

## Tech Stack Used

- **Vite**: Enables fast development and optimized builds.
- **React + TypeScript**: Provides a robust framework for building interactive user interfaces with type safety.
- **Netlify**: Offers simple and efficient hosting with excellent performance.

## Features
Beetroot focuses on delivering essential functionalities to help users minimize food waste:

- **Inventory Management**: Allows users to log and monitor their food items, keeping track of quantities and expiration dates.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Recommends recipes based on the ingredients users have on hand, encouraging the use of existing food items.
- **Community Sharing**: Facilitates the sharing of surplus food with others in the community, promoting collective efforts to reduce waste.
- **Notifications**: Alerts users when food items are nearing their expiration dates, prompting timely consumption.

## Challenges and How I Dealt with Them

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

Designing an intuitive interface that encourages user engagement without overwhelming them was a key challenge. I focused on creating a clean and straightforward user experience, ensuring that the core functionalities are easily accessible and user-friendly.

Integrating community sharing features required careful consideration of privacy and trust. Implementing user authentication and secure data handling practices helped build a reliable platform for users to connect and share resources safely.
